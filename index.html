                        <p>Simply add in the details of a single client and you can instantly send out an email from ReviewSolicitors asking the client if they would like to leave a review.
                            <br> You can even add a personal message to the client. </p>

                        <p>If you have multiple clients that you would like to send review requests to, you can add their details to a CSV file and upload them all at once. This is a quick method to send out multiple review requests. You can send out up to 5000 review requests at once. </p>

</span>
                        <p>If you would like one simple link that multiple clients can use to leave you a review then this is your perfect option. Simply copy the link and add this as a link to client emails, closing documents or personal correspondence you have with the client. Please note that anybody who has access to this link can leave a review so it’s important to only share this link with your own clients directly. If your firm has multiple branches then you can have a separate link for each branch. </p>

                        <p>If you would personally like to ask clients to provide a review, rather than have ReviewSolicitors email the client you can do so here. Simply provide the client details and you will generate a link that you can personally email to the client. These requests can be personalised</p>

                        <p>If a client does not wish to be contacted via email, this method allows you to send a paper copy of the ReviewSolicitors questionnaire to them and then manually upload this into the system. This method does not produce a high response rate like other methods of review collection. We only recommend using this for clients who you do not hold an email address for</p>

automatically ask clients for a review</span>
                        <p>By far the most popular and hassle free method of review collection. Simply tell us which case management system you use and who your account manager is and we will get in contact with them. Once integrated each client who passes through your firm will receive an email asking them to leave a review. No admin required, simply sit back and let the reviews roll in. </p>

        <p class="notes"><a href="">ReviewSolicitors</a> provides you with multiple ways to collect client reviews. We understand that each and every firm is different and the clients you act for will differ too. <br>
Using the above methods you can choose to interact with your clients in a way that suits your firm.</p>
